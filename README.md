# Decore

Swift applications architecture **framework**, providing a set of abstractions to compose 
your data layer, dependencies, and side-effects using automaticaly calculated dependency graph.

**Decore library** provides all the types and protocols to enable the framework in your app.
 
**WORK IN PROGRESS**
Current version is in active development stage.
**Please only use it in your experiments only**, the library and components is not yet tested.

All those who still use the old implementation of Decore 
(which I do not reccommend to use in the apps other than experiments) 
use the last experimental verion: `0.1.1`
